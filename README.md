Here's the updated guide to execute your code with the specified filename `Shimer_Key_Constant.js`. 

### How to Execute the Code

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `catalog` repository. You can use the following command:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/catalog
   ```

2. **Navigate to the `catalog_drive` Folder**:
   Inside the `catalog` directory, navigate to the `catalog_drive` folder where your code and JSON files are located:
   ```bash
   cd catalog_drive
   ```

3. **Ensure Node.js is Installed**:
   Make sure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   If Node.js is not installed, download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Run the Code**:
   Execute your JavaScript file using Node.js with the filename `Shimer_Key_Constant.js`:
   ```bash
   node Shimer_Key_Constant.js
   ```

5. **Check the Output**:
   After running the command, you should see the output printed in the terminal. This will include the processed information from your JSON files, such as the decoded values and the computed constant term.

### Example Commands

Here's how the commands might look:

```bash
cd path/to/your/catalog
cd catalog_drive
node Shimer_Key_Constant.js
```

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that your input JSON files (e.g., `input1.json`, `input2.json`, etc.) are located in the `catalog_drive` folder alongside your `Shimer_Key_Constant.js` script.
- Make sure your JSON files are formatted correctly as per the required structure for the script to execute without errors.

This simple guide should help you execute your code effectively!
